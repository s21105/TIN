		get off the grid or explore a city</li>
        <li>Barcelona is the largest city in Catalonia and has over a dozen Antoni Gaudí installations scattered throughout. The most famous
		being Sagrada Familia and Park Güell, this city is perfect for any fan of Catalan modernism.</li>
        <li>Known as the southernmost spot in the United States, Key West is synonymous with heaven. You can do everything here,

        <li>Each year starting in the end of November and peaking in early December, fields of bright purple Russell Lupins bloom across New Zealand's South Island.
		One of the most beautiful spots to go Lupin-spotting is in Fiordland National Park, home to the equally gorgeous Milford Sound.
